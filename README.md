## Projects
- PLASM: PLASM is a new 64-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) designed to minimize code size and improve memory efficiency. The ISA has been carefully crafted to reduce the amount of code required to perform common operations, resulting in smaller and more compact binaries. The reduced code size also reduces the amount of memory required to store the code, freeing up more memory for data and increasing overall system performance. PLASM's focus on code size reduction is particularly beneficial for embedded systems, where memory is often a scarce resource. In addition, the ISA's design emphasizes ease of implementation, making it a cost-effective option for device manufacturers. Overall, PLASM is a modern ISA that balances code size optimization and performance, making it a valuable addition to the growing landscape of computer architecture options.
- PLASMbler: PLASMbler is a code assembler and language for the PLASM 64-bit instruction set architecture. It is written in C and provides a simple and intuitive interface for assembling PLASM code. PLASMbler includes features such as automatic code generation and error checking, making it easy for developers to write and assemble code. With its straightforward syntax and efficient code assembly capabilities, PLASMbler is a valuable tool for developers working with the PLASM ISA, streamlining the code assembly process and improving the overall quality of PLASM code.
- mkpsin: mkpsin is a documentation generator written in C, designed specifically for generating markdown documentation of instruction sets, with a focus on PLASM. It provides a simple and efficient way for developers to create and maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation for PLASM code. mkpsin automatically generates documentation from the PLASM instruction set, eliminating the need for manual documentation and reducing the risk of errors or inaccuracies. The generated markdown documentation is easy to read, navigate, and maintain, making it a valuable resource for both developers and users of PLASM code. With its powerful and intuitive features, mkpsin is an essential tool for anyone working with the PLASM ISA, helping to ensure accurate and up-to-date documentation for PLASM code.
